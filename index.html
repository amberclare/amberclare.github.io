<h3>Why I aspire to become a coder</h3>
<p>For most of my professional career I have worked as a secretary. It is a very traditional, female dominated role. It is also a dying field.
As with many other industries, much of the work I do as a secretary is becoming automated. From using speech to text recognition instead of transcribing to automated billing my profession is becoming obselete.
Having a secretary has always been a luxury for the people  </p>
