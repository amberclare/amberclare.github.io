    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>This is me, Amber Willimott, on a web page. It took me a little while to find my place in the world. Traditional school wasn’t for me, turns out, I really like practical hands on and problem solving work, and have found my happy place working with food, pottery, travel and coding.</p>
    <p>After finishing Year Twelve, I landed a sweet gig as a legal secretary for a big law firm, but trapped in an office, doing the same thing every day isn’t for me, I want something that challenges me more and lets me be creative in my daily life.</p>
    <p>Below is a narrative of how my life has led to this point, applying for this scholarship.</p>
    <p>My mum was like me, she didn’t like mainstream school, and is often found at a table, completing hard-core jigsaw puzzles. I love doing these with her. I can rotate the pieces in my mind and see how they will fit together – something my older sister found infuriating as she just couldn’t sit still long enough to find the solution. This should have been the first sign that hands on style learning was my calling.</p>
    <p>In Year Eight, I was popped into a basic coding class where we used Lego and had to make it move. It was really fun, like solving a puzzle – I was hooked!</p>
    <p>Year Nine comes along, and the best technology subject they could offer me was jewellery making or wood work, and they were fun, but didn’t interest me like the Lego subject did.</p>
    <p>My school (an all girls' school) didn’t offer anything similar, and career guidance put me on a path to an office job.</p>
    <p>By the time I turned 21, I met a coder, we’ll call him J, and talking to him, made me realise that there were jobs out there that could be fun and challenging and rewarding. It was my hands on, creative, puzzle solving career path, that had been taunting me since Year Eight!.</p>

    <h3>Why I aspire to become a coder</h3>

    <p>My long term goals are to blaze a trail for likeminded, puzzle solving women, who want to seek an alternate path.</p>
    <p>Make women visible in a field traditionally dominated by men, and hold my own in the world of coding.</p>
    <p>Make a difference in the world and evolve with the 21st Century workforce.</p>
    <p>Make coding badass women such as Frances Spence and Anita Borg proud.</p>
    <p>See that coding based subjects become common place in Australian classrooms by chewing off my sisters’ ear on a regular basis (she’s a high school teacher).</p>
    <p>Mentor and inspire other girls to move into the profession.</p>
    <p>Continue to be a lifelong learner.</p>

    <h3>The pottery metaphor</h3>

    <p>Pottery is my creative outlet.
    <p>Clay is so tactile, you can do anything with it, just like code! Spin it on a wheel to create perfect vessels or mold it with you hands to shape it into anything your heart desires. My journey through clay has many similarities to my journey so far through learning to code. </p>
    <p>I have collated a selection of my works at different stages of my pottery journey and compared them to their coding journey counterparts, as I see them.</p>

                The very first piece I made was this ugly little ashtray (I'm it's creator, I'm allowed to call it ugly). It was a simple exercise in working with clay, learning what it feels like and it how you can maniputale it. I liken this to when I first started to play with code. I really had no idea what I was doing and a made a mess but it was a lot of fun!

                This sculpture was another learning exercise. It was created by making two pinch pots and joining them together. Adding different elements was challenging and I was very careful as I really wanted a viable product. The first time I added CSS to a simple HTML page felt very similar, I previewed each element before moving on to the next to make sure it worked and I was very nervous adding more and more styles.

                  My citrus juicer was the first really functional piece of pottery that I made. I really wanted to make something I could use in real life. I made the juicer by attaching a pinch pot to a bowl made in a mold. I also painted little pictures of fruit which was the firt time I painted anything other than a solid colour onto my work, just like the first time adding images to an page.

                Once you start to understand how the clay works you are able to aim for more precice forms. This bowl is the first one I was able to properly centre on the wheel and it came out almost perfect. I worked really hard to make something that looked professional and that people would recognise at first glance as an actual bowl. Does this look like an actual website to you???

                Another wheel thrown pot but this one is a bit of a flop (literally). It was a not so gentle reminder that it is easy to go to far or make silly mistakes. Taking risks is part of the fun. Programmers break their code all the time, right!?

                Before making this piece I had never made a plate. It took different techniques and handling to make it work, it took longer to shape than most of the stuff I have made. Almost like trying out a new language for the first time.

    <p>In learning pottery I have learnt that it takes practice, patience, persistence and perseverance. These principles apply in learning to code just as they do in pottery. I love the challenge and problem solving that pottery and coding present. Trying new things is exciting because I never really know how it will work out. I might make a masterpiece or there might be a meltdown...who cares! What matters is learning something new and trying something different.</p>
