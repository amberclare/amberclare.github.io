    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>I am Amber Willimott. I am a lover of cooking, pottery, travel and coding. I have lived in Melbourne all my life and I have spent the last few years working as a legal secretary but now I am trying to sculpt a new future for myself. I want to learn new skills so I can help people and make a difference. I dream of travelling and working all over the world and I hope that my choices will get me there. Check out my profiles on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/fccbb9a4371">Free Code Camp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/amberclare">Github</a> and <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/amber-willimott-14169b73"> Linkedin</a>.</p>

    <h3>Pottery gallery</h3>

    <p>Pottery is my creative outlet. Clay is so tactile, you can do anything with it. Spin it on a wheel to create perfect vessels or mold it with you hands to shape it into anything your heart desires. My journey through clay has many similarities to my journey so far through learning to code. I have collated a selection of my works at different stages of my pottery journey and compared them to their coding journey counterparts, as I see them.</p>

                The very first piece I made was this ugly little ashtray (I'm it's creator, I'm allowed to call it ugly). It was a simple exercise in working with clay, learning what it feels like and it how you can maniputale it. I liken this to when I first started to play with code. I really had no idea what I was doing and a made a mess but it was a lot of fun!

                This sculpture was another learning exercise. It was created by making two pinch pots and joining them together. Adding different elements was challenging and I was very careful as I really wanted a viable product. The first time I added CSS to a simple HTML page felt very similar, I previewed each element before moving on to the next to make sure it worked and I was very nervous adding more and more styles.

                  My citrus juicer was the first really functional piece of pottery that I made. I really wanted to make something I could use in real life. I made the juicer by attaching a pinch pot to a bowl made in a mold. I also painted little pictures of fruit which was the firt time I painted anything other than a solid colour onto my work, just like the first time adding images to an page.

                Once you start to understand how the clay works you are able to aim for more precice forms. This bowl is the first one I was able to properly centre on the wheel and it came out almost perfect. I worked really hard to make something that looked professional and that people would recognise at first glance as an actual bowl. Does this look like an actual website to you???

                Another wheel thrown pot but this one is a bit of a flop (literally). It was a not so gentle reminder that it is easy to go to far or make silly mistakes. Taking risks is part of the fun. Programmers break their code all the time, right!?

                Before making this piece I had never made a plate. It took different techniques and handling to make it work, it took longer to shape than most of the stuff I have made. Almost like trying out a new language for the first time.

    <p>In learning pottery I have learnt that it takes practice, patience, persistence and perseverance. These principles apply in learning to code just as they do in pottery. I love the challenge and problem solving that pottery and coding present. Trying new things is exciting because I never really know how it will work out. I might make a masterpiece or there might be a meltdown...who cares! What matters is learning something new and trying something different.</p>

    <h3>Why I aspire to become a coder</h3>

    <p>For most of my professional career I have worked as a secretary. It is a very traditional, female dominated career. It is also a dying field. Having a secretary has always been a luxury but is now seen as an expensive overhead that can be replaced or outsourced. I want to become a coder so that I can be a trail-blazer for women and start a new trend that will secure a future in coding for women. I want women like myself to see that they can make a change in their own life and take control of their careers without spending years at university. It is my dream that I can be an inspiration for young girls and to encourage coding from an early age. Our future is going to be based around technology and I don't want us to get left behind!</p>
