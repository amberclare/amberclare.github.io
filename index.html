<h2>My life as a coder</h2>

<h3>About me</h3>

<h3>Ceramic art gallery</h3>
<p>Pottery is my creative outlet. The clay is so tactile, you can do anything with it. Spin it on a wheel to create perfect vessels or mould it with you hands to shape it into anything your heart desires.
My journey through clay has many similarities to my journey so far through learning to code. I have collated a selection of my works at different stages of my pottery journey and compared them to their coding journey counterparts, as I see them.</p>

<h3>Why I aspire to become a coder</h3>
<p>For most of my professional career I have worked as a secretary. It is a very traditional, female dominated role. It is also a dying field.
As with many other industries, much of the work I do as a secretary is becoming automated. From using speech to text recognition instead of transcribing to automated billing my profession is becoming obselete.
Having a secretary has always been a luxury for the people who can afford it but is now seen as an expensive overhead that can be replaced.
