<h3 class="Julius+Sans+One">About me</h3>
<p class="Abel">I am Amber Willimott. I am a lover of cooking, pottery, travel and coding. I have lived in Melbourne all my life and I have spent the last few years working as a legal secretary but now I am trying to sculpt a new future for myself. I want to learn new skills so I can help people and make a difference. I dream of travelling and working all over the world and I hope that my choices will get me there.
  Check out my profiles on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/fccbb9a4371">Free Code Camp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/amberclare">Github</a>.</p>

<h3 class="Julius+Sans+One">Ceramic art gallery</h3>
<p class="Abel">Pottery is my creative outlet. Clay is so tactile, you can do anything with it. Spin it on a wheel to create perfect vessels or mold it with you hands to shape it into anything your heart desires.
My journey through clay has many similarities to my journey so far through learning to code. I have collated a selection of my works at different stages of my pottery journey and compared them to their coding journey counterparts, as I see them.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4"><img class="thin-grey-border" src="ashtray.jpg" alt="ashtray" style="width:100px;height:100px;"><div class="caption text-center Abel">The very first piece I made was this ugly little ashtray. It was a simple exercise in working with clay, learning what it feels like and it how you can maniputale it.
    I liken this to when I first started to play with code. I really had no idea what I was doing and a made a mess but it was a lot of fun!</div></div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4"><img class="thin-grey-border" src="strawberry.jpg" alt="strawberry" style="width:100px;height:100px;"><div class="caption text-center Abel">This sculpture was another learning exercise. It was created by making two pinch pots and joining them together. Adding different elements was challenging and I was very careful as I really wanted a viable product. The first time I added CSS to a simple HTML app felt very similar, I previewed each element before moving on to the next to make sure it worked and I was very nervous adding more and more styles.</div></div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4"><img class="thin-grey-border" src="juicer.jpg" alt="juicer" style="width:100px;height:100px;"><div class="caption text-center Abel">My citrus juicer was the first really functional piece of pottery that I made. I really wanted to make something I could use in real life. I made the juicer by attaching a pinch pot to a bowl made in a mold. I also painted little pictures of fruit which was the firt time I painted anything other than a solid colour onto my work, just like the first time adding images to an app.</div></div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4"><img class="thin-grey-border" src="bowl.jpg" alt="bowl" style="width:100px;height:100px;"><div class="caption text-center Abel">Once you start to understand how the clay works you are able to aim for more precice forms. This bowl is the first one I was able to properly centre on the wheel and it came out almost perfect. I worked relly hard to make something that looked professional and that people would recognise at first glance.</div></div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4"><img class="thin-grey-border" src="flop.jpg" alt="flop" style="width:100px;height:100px;"><div class="caption text-center Abel">Another wheel thrown pot but this one is a bit of a flop. It was a not so gentle reminder that it is easy to go to far or make silly mistakes. </div></div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4"><img class="thin-grey-border" src="square.jpg" alt="square" style="width:100px;height:100px;"><div class="caption text-center Abel">Before making this piece I had never made a plate. It took different techniques and handling to make it work almost like trying out a new language for the first time.</div></div>
</div>
<p class="Abel">In learning pottery I have learnt that it takes practice, patience, persistence and perseverance. These principles apply in learning to code just as they do in pottery. </p>
<h3 class="Julius+Sans+One">Why I aspire to become a coder</h3>
<p class="Abel">For most of my professional career I have worked as a secretary. It is a very traditional, female dominated role. It is also a dying field.
As with many other industries, much of the work I do as a secretary is becoming automated. From using speech to text recognition instead of transcribing to automated billing my profession is becoming obselete.
Having a secretary has always been a luxury for the people who can afford it but is now seen as an expensive overhead that can be replaced.
